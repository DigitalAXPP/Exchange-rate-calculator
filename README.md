# Exchange-rate-calculator
An API and a CLI to calculate exchange rates.

Thank you very much for this interesting task. So far I have neither worked with JSON nor an API but it was a pleasant surprise. It was an interesting challenge which forced me to document my code much more than I usually did for myself. 

By the way, I was so sure about the work instructions that I failed to confirm that what I was writing was actually what the instructions were demanding. Nevertheless, thank you for the interesting challenge.

Best regards,

Alexander Piepenhagen
